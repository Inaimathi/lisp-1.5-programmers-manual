# Lisp 1.5 Programmers' Manual
###### COPY RIGHT 1978 by:
###### FRITS VAN DER WATEREN

### Note from the typist

This is as direct a reproduction as I could manage of the LISP 1.5 programmers manual for the [M6800 microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800). In the interests of readability, I've left off the page headers, added minor bits of formatting where it seemed appropriate, and corrected minor spelling and grammar errors in the original. As of this writing, there are no other digital versions available. [Paul Tarvydas](https://github.com/guitarvydas?tab=activity) has gotten permission from the original author to digitize it for posterity.

The complete manual came on ~60 physical pages at a maximum of 64 fairly sparse lines per page, so I decided it would be easier to just re-type rather than deal with OCR issues. Also, I'm fucking bored. Let me know if you've caught an error.

Original scans are in lisp15.pdf. Some pages have pencil notes made by Paul which are not transcribed. 

### The source code

The file lisp.asm was contributed by guitarvydas on Github. Thanks to Kendal Goodson for this lates copy (LISP.TXT). "As Is", found on a FLEX O/S games disk. Some obvious typos in the code have been corrected. A reasonable effort has been made to verify the code on a 6800 emulator and some additional issues has been corrected. There may be more errors.

### The Dr. Dobbs original article

The article was contributed by ka5kxw on Github., and was taken from the September 1978 issue of Dr. Dobbs. Ot had Frits' description of his lisp system along with a handy definition of DEF for the interpreter.
