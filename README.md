### Note from the typist

This is as direct a reproduction as I could manage of the LISP 1.5 programmers manual for the [M6800 microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800). In the interests of readability, I've left off the page headers, added minor bits of formatting where it seemed appropriate, and corrected minor spelling and grammar errors in the original. As of this writing, there are no other digital versions available. [Paul Tarvydas](https://github.com/guitarvydas?tab=activity) has gotten permission from the original author to digitize it for posterity.

The complete manual came on ~60 physical pages at a maximum of 64 fairly sparse lines per page, so I decided it would be easier to just re-type rather than deal with OCR issues. Also, I'm fucking bored. Let me know if you've caught an error.

Original scans are kept in the `scans/` sub-directory. Some pages have pencil notes made by Paul which I will not transcribe. If you want to transcribe some in parallel with me, feel free. As of this writing, I'm up to file `009.tif`.
