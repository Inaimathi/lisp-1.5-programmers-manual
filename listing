*
* LISP STARTS AT $100
*      AND AUTOMATICALLY ALLOCATES all contiguous memory
*      and reserves 7/8 for cell storage (4 bytes per cell)
*      and 1/8 for stack (2 bytes per word)
*
* Restart is at $103
*      the current oblist is mantained but the
*      a-list bindings are lost.
*      Furthermore a garbage collection is forced.
*
*
* The device table is located at $106
*      And can be extended by two more devices.
*      Implemented handlers are:
*      #1 TTY      With an ACIA at $FF00
*      #2 READER   with a PIA at $FF10 (A)
*      #3 PUNCH    with a PIA at $FF10 (B)
